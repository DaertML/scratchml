# Scratch ML: An ML framework from scratch
![logo]scratchml.jpeg
Machine Learning and Deep Learning framework developed from scratch in Python.

## Getting started
0. Clone this repo
1. Install nnfs
2. Install numpy
3. Run the python file "modular_fullstep.py".

Once you do it, you will see how the accuracy improves and your loss reduces; on a randomly generated dataset.

## Future plans
This project started as a way to teach ourselves how neural networks really worked; after years of writing tensorflow code, and feeling like we
wanted to have more control on how the models got trained. Because of that, we feel like scratchml is a great tool to get you started from scratch
in machine learning and deep learning topics. We are planning on providing a course to develop the framework from scratch, and let you truly learn
how neural networks and machine learning works.

In addition, we would like scratchml to be much more than a library used for learning purposes, to implement neural networks and machine learning with Python;
we feel like common frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow work great, but they could be much further improved; we believe there is already a lot of code that
makes it difficult to study a way to improve the implementation of separate pieces; in addition, we are planning to make it a competitive framework to run in
certain architectures and GPUs.

## Why Scratch ML?
At Daert, we felt like the best way to feel like you are doing Machine Learning from scratch, is when you import the Python libraries, and write:
"from scratchml import *" it truly felt like a way of saying "from scratch ml", and the name stuck with us.
